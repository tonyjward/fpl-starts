"""Scoring harness: score archived predictions against actual outcomes.

docs/build_spec_p_starts.md Section 8 (calibration harness), 8.0
(validation protocol), 8.1 (scoring loop), 8b (stratified reporting and the
class-imbalance trap).

**Never report a single pool-wide Brier score.** Section 8b shows Deep
(never-starts players) is ~41% of rows and trivially predictable, which
flatters any pool average into hiding exactly the improvement that matters.
Rotation-stratum Brier is the headline metric; Core/Marginal/Deep are
reported for completeness only. The model must beat all three baselines
(persistence, season-rate, constant 0.9) to justify shipping it (Section 8.1).

Strata are labelled from the same pre-target-round history used to build the
predictions being scored -- never from the round being scored, which would
leak the answer into the stratum that matters most (Section 8.0 rule 2).

Both predictions and actual outcomes must already be archived: predictions
via starts_model.py + derived.py, outcomes via the raw archiver + derived.py
once the gameweek's data_checked. This module only reads derived.db and the
community archive (for the persistence/season-rate baselines, which need
the same cross-season history starts_model.py uses to predict) -- it never
writes anything.

Python 3.7 target: no walrus operator, no `X | Y` unions, no f-string `=`.
