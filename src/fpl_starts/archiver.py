"""Raw archiver for the FPL API.

Writes every fetched payload byte-for-byte to a write-once, gzip-compressed
file and appends one line to a per-season manifest. See
docs/build_spec_p_starts.md Section 2.3a for the full spec this
implements.

Two invariants everything downstream depends on:
  - the raw layer is never parsed, edited, or overwritten -- only appended to.
  - the manifest is the index of the archive: every "ok" line must point at
    a real file with a matching hash, and every raw file must have a line.

Python 3.7 target: no walrus operator, no `X | Y` unions, no f-string `=`.
